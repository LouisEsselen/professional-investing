                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">With the mass audience on social media, it became the perfect place for social trading platforms to thrive. If you think about it, every person with a social media account has friends. They connect with old and new friends and build their audience with people they like and trust.<br><br>So, social media became an acceptable norm for most people to communicate with their chosen audiences, which also set the stage for conducting business on social media.<br> 
<br>With this in mind, it created a perfect platform to attract buyers and transact business. People talk and share ideas, and what better place to promote than on social trading platforms? <br><br>The concept of "social" is already acceptable to most.<br> 
<br>In no time at all, social trading platforms mushroomed and attracted clients. Like-minded people could get together on social trading platforms to make quick bucks! Getting help from your favorite social trader and copying his trades became very appealing. <br><br>With accounts set up taking only a few minutes, you are off to the races!<br><br>That may sound like the perfect idea in an ideal world, but in reality, it's very far from the real world of trading, that is!!<br><br>Unfortunately, It does not work that way, as I am about to reveal the shocking truth about social trading.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>How can you believe a trader's profile and the results he publishes on a social platform? <br><br>How do you know if the profile is accurate or not?&nbsp; How do you verify his trading claims? Many traders on these platforms use pseudonym usernames. So you have no way of knowing who the natural person is or if his claims as an expert are actual.<br>
<br>To fuel the fire, most trading "gurus' on social trading platforms have no prior knowledge of trading or qualifications in finance.&nbsp;<br>Trading in this environment is literary, like the Wild West.<br> <br><strong>The brutal truth about brokers</strong><br>To make matters worse, trading brokers are&nbsp;in business to get people to open as many trading accounts as possible and trade as often as possible. That is how they make their money.&nbsp;<br><br>They could not care less if you make money or not. They are not in business to train you either. They exist to make money from your trades. They rely on a high-volume turnover of trading accounts to make their money. Comprehensive trader training is non-existent with all the financial market brokers and social trading platforms because it’s not their business model.&nbsp;<br><br>Aside from the fact that there is much to learn about the markets and market structure, it is not difficult to learn how to trade, and you don't need a Ph.D. But copying trades from gurus on social platforms is not the answer. Hopefully, you are starting to realize this!<br></p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-2">Here is the shocker of social trading, and what I found</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">While looking through the profiles of traders to copy and follow, I found the following amusing.<br><br><strong>Traders Profile one</strong><br>While scrolling through a social trading site (name withheld), I found a "guru" trader to follow. He described himself as a rational trader and short to medium-term investor with experience in portfolio construction. He makes decisions based on growth potential, relative cost, and upside potential. He also mentioned owning and selling a brokerage but did not say what kind!<br><br>Immediately, the alarm bells rang when he said his experience was in portfolio construction. To my knowledge, the trading mindset differs significantly from the inside mindset for portfolio construction. So, I would not trust this trader's decisions. <br><br><strong>You cannot compare the financial markets to construction. There is no correlation between the two</strong>.<br><br>The bottom line is I would not follow nor copy this trader.<br><br><strong>Trader profile two</strong><br>This trader<strong>&nbsp;</strong>says he's an elite pro "popular investor" and has been trading for three years with an impressive 69 percent return on investment (what we don't know is in what context this is. (collectively over three years or yearly returns) with almost 18k followers, you must invest 500 Euro to copy his trades.<br><br>This profile looks very enticing, and who could resist the temptation not to copy his trades? On this platform, the broker pays a "popular investor" when other traders copy his trades. The more traders copy him, the more money he makes (from how much they trade). Remember, the broker does not care about you and whether you make money or not. They only care about the volume of trades and get paid from the spreads. (difference between the sell and buy price)<br><br>It's a win for the pro-investor and not necessarily for you. It's a typical profile that will suck in new traders and investors. It's as risky as any other offer to copy trades, especially when you know nothing about trading!</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">You would think participating in social trading would be a more supportive environment than trading on your own. This is not the case with what I discovered. The opposite is more a true reflection of social trading.<br>Loneliness is more evident in social trading than what you think and believe. I found several questions from participants that went unanswered. So, we can deduce that there is no support and care for others in a social trading environment.<br><br>These are some of the critical questions that went unanswered.<br><br>" I've never traded before. Can you tell me if this app (name withheld) is good? I saw terrible reviews like they take money from your account. Is it worth investing long-term? His question was never answered.<br><br>Another guy says he can't close each stock. The pending button is showing. Then he says: " I chose a long-time investor.<br><strong>He gets this answer:</strong>- Idiot, the market is closed! Would you tolerate a solution like this from the “elite trader” you are copying? And someone you paid to copy?<br> 
<br>I certainly don’t think so.<br>
<br><strong>Question: </strong>Hello, do you think it is an excellent point to start copying open trades? I appreciate any help you can provide.
<br>Hi. I want to copy you. I want to ask, because you don’t trade cryptos, how much return is expected from stocks per year if I start now, let’s say? What’s the average per year?<br><br><strong>Question:</strong><br>Hi, that's probably a dumb question. I am looking at jumping in to copy you. I am still confused, so I am holding off on payment. Do I invest the $1000, then hit copy and leave it? Or do I need to check in and move money, including hitting copy each time? And do I keep adding more to my fund each month or a few weeks? What happens if I only have $2,000 and then have no more to invest for a few months, what happens then?<br><br>I'm sure you'll agree that social trading and copying other traders are not a wise choice.&nbsp; You read the pitfalls and the situations you can get yourself into. <br><br>Now&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">If you were the person asking the last question, you had a choice to spend $1000 - $2000 on a professional trading education conducted by a qualified professional and former bank trader. Would you choose a professional trading education or mess around on social platforms?<br>
<br>I guess you would choose to <a href="professionaldaytrader.html" class="text-primary"><strong>get trained by a professional</strong></a>. Am I correct?
<br>
<br>Imagine you decided on a professional trading education. You gained all the knowledge possible to trade professionally, became a champion at managing risk, and learned to recognize high-probability trades.<br>&nbsp;<br>Where could you be in 6 months, a year from now, or two years?  How would your life change?
<br>Where would you be living? 
<br>
<br>This is how you can turn your life around. You only need to make a choice.<br>
Your first choice is to <a href="professionaldaytrader.html" class="text-primary"><strong>invest in yourself</strong></a> with a professional education and not follow&nbsp; "guru" retail traders.<br>
<br>The choice is yours. Make it a wise choice.
