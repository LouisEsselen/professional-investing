                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7"><br>It is easy to see why social trading and social trading platforms are becoming more and more popular in the world today. Social media has grown exponentially, and the number of people communicating with these channels is a staggering 3.8 billion, according to 2020 figures.<br><br>That’s a lot of people, folks!<br><br>It has also become the perfect business model for startups of social trading brokerages. Why?<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Well, the answer is simple. With an audience of 3.8 billion already present on social media channels like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, they share experiences, make new friends, connect with old friends, sell something, etc.
<br>Social media sites have become an acceptable way for most people to connect to their chosen audiences and those interested in business opportunities. Ha-ha, bingo!<br> 
<br>With this in mind, it creates a perfect platform to transact differently. 
<br>Like joining a social trading platform, find a “professional” trader and link up your trading platform to his, pay your money into your account, sit back, and watch the money roll in.<br><br>That sounds great in a perfect world and very far from <strong>the real world</strong>.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, It does not work that way.<br>
<br>I speak here from my ten years of experience in trading and understanding how the trading industry works from the inside. Brokers lure the unsuspecting public to join their trading platforms to open accounts for copy trading or trading on their own.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The truth is.</strong><br>Why would you give your money to some stranger to invest and trade through a copy trade connection when all you have to go on is what he says in his profile and the results he publishes? That is the most insane investing decision you can ever make.<br>
<br>What I am about to illustrate to you should open your eyes to the absolute truth about copy trading and why you should avoid it. Most people joining social trading platforms have no prior knowledge of trading and are there because of the appeal and curiosity. The ‘social connection” with another person who appears to know what they are doing and you copying his trades.&nbsp;<br>
<br>Comprehensive trader training is non-existent with all the financial market brokers and social trading platforms <strong>because it’s not their business model.</strong> <strong>They are not in business to train you. </strong>They <strong>exist to make money</strong> from your trades.&nbsp;<br><br>They’re in business to get people to open as many trading accounts as possible and trade as often as possible. That is how they make their money. They could not care less if you make money or not. They rely on a high-volume turnover of trading accounts.<br>
<br>Aside from the fact that there is much to learn about the markets and market structure, it is not difficult to learn how to trade. You don't need a Ph.D. degree.

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5"><strong>Some examples I found</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Here is the trader’s Profile: </strong>(text is not edited)<br><em> I consider myself a rational trader and short to medium-term investor as I have previously founded and sold a brokerage that was based in (location withheld). I have a lot of experience in portfolio construction and I make decisions based on the growth potential, relative cost, and the amount of potential upside</em>.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>My comment:</strong><br>That’s a new one ‘rational trader” - what the heck?
<br>&nbsp;His experience is in portfolio construction. What has that to do with trading? Look what his decisions are based on! Ask yourself, seriously, would you invest with this trader?&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Another profile</strong>:<em> He is an Elite pro popular investor and trading for 3 years with a 69% return on investment according to his record with almost 18,000 copy followers you need 500 euro to start.</em><br><em>
</em><br>Here are some concerned traders’ questions. Many I can add have never been replied to.&nbsp;So where does that leave the newbie trader? Stranded of course, with no support.
<br><br><strong>Question:</strong>  I am new, and I’ve never traded in my life. Can you tell me please if {name withheld} is a good app? I mean I saw bad reviews like, they take money from your bank or put money when you withdraw very late, can you tell me please, is worth to put money long term, thanks.<br><br><strong>My comment:</strong> His question was not answered.
<br><strong>Question:</strong> I can’t close each stock. I am stuck on the pending close button. Can u guys do something about it. I mistakenly chose a long-time investor.<br>
<br><strong>My comment</strong>: How is this for an answer from the trader: Idiot, the market is closed 
<br>Would you tolerate an answer like this from your “elite trader” whom you are copying? And have you given your money to? 
<br>I certainly don’t think so.<br>
<br><strong>Question: </strong>Hello, do you think it is a good point to start copying open trades? Thanks in advance!
<br>Hi. I want to copy you. Just want to ask because you don’t trade cryptos, how much return is expected from stocks per year if i start now let’s say? What’s the average per year?<br>
<br><strong>Question: </strong>Hello, may I know why your trading has stopped?
<br>
<br>Sadly, many of these questions never get answered, meaning you are alone.<br>
<br><strong>Another question:</strong> Hey! I’m new to {name withheld} and copied {name withheld} but only with £200. Can someone please explain to me how things work? Cheers to all!
<br><strong>My comment</strong>: What is this trader doing? He knows nothing and decides to invest mindlessly and copy a trader!<br> 
<br>Take a look at this question.<br>
<br>Hi, prob a dumb question, looking at jumping in on copying you. I am still confused so holding off atm, do I invest the $1000, then hit copy and leave it? or do I need to check in and move money, including hitting copy each time? And each month, or few weeks I keep adding more into my fund? And what happens if I only have $2,000 then no more to invest for few months, what happens then?
<br>
<br><strong>Do you see what I mean, folks? Talk about the blind leading the blind!</strong><br>
<br> I am jumping in with $1000 like a typical sheep following the flock—money to throw away with no idea (nor any trading ideas).<br>By the way, If anyone else is also giving away £200 and $1000, please send it to me. I think I could put it to use better 😊<br><br><strong>
