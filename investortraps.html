                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The biggest threat to your financial independence is how you think about investing. There's a strong tendency to act according to your existing beliefs about the information. We're naturally wired to seek pleasure and ignore anything painful or attempt anything different.
<br>When you process information, you accept it as consistent with your beliefs. We tend to see the world not as it is but how we want it to look!<br><br>The best way to make better decisions about anything is to learn as much as possible and understand what you are doing and why.<br>
<br><strong>How financially literate are you? </strong>Take this test.<br><br>Here is a short test. As simple as the questions appear, it's astonishing how many knew the correct answers.
<br>Here are the four basic multiple-choice financial questions. Write your answers down and check the correct ones.<br>
<br><strong>1. What is the safest investment asset class?
</strong><br>Stocks <strong>or&nbsp;</strong>real estate <strong>or&nbsp;</strong>futures <strong>or</strong> treasury bonds
<br>53% got this one right
<br><strong>2. What happens to bond prices when interest rates rise? 
</strong><br>Bond prices do not change <strong>or&nbsp;</strong>bond prices fall <strong>or</strong>&nbsp;bond prices rise
<br>25% got this one correct
<br><strong>3. What is a bull market?
</strong><br>Expect stock prices to fall <strong>or&nbsp;</strong>expect stock prices to rise <strong>or&nbsp;</strong>people are not optimistic about future prices
<br>53% were correct
<br><strong>4. What happens to your stock if the company goes bankrupt?
</strong><br>The stock is sold to a 3rd party buyer <strong>or&nbsp;</strong>the stock increases in value&nbsp;<strong>or</strong>&nbsp;the stock becomes virtually worthless.<br>And 64 % got their correct<br>
<br>On average, 48.7 % of the questions answered correctly indicated less than half of those participants are financially literate.
<br>
<br><br>Here are the answers:
<br>(1)Treasury bonds (2) Bond prices fall (3) Expect stock prices to rise (4) The stock becomes almost worthless&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The reason why you need a different mental approach to investing is because of your fear-based brain. The fear of losing is ever-present and a powerful emotion. Nobody likes losing. We all want to win. Right? To make matters worse, when the markets are in a downturn, it’s natural for anyone to panic and sell the asset.<br>
<br>Without enough knowledge of what you are investing in, fear is most of the time in control of your decision-making. If you have made long-term investment decisions that are very volatile in the short term, nothing will affect your thought process because you are investing for the long term.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Investor <strong>Trap 3 </strong>-Using Recent Events to Gauge Future Results</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Here is a typical example of how many people fall into this trap. A particular stock is dominating recent news headlines. It's all over the media, exploding in value, so you act on this new information and buy the stock. Did you ask yourself, is this a short-term or long-term investment idea? No. So, without realizing it, you have paid a high price for the stock and bought it at the wrong time. The stock could crash for weeks, months, or years!<br>
<br>These are typical traps many investors get caught in. Following the crowd seldom makes investors rich. Thinking short term is also a very different mental approach to investing long-term.<br> 
<br>You must focus on the correct mental approach and forget about short-term interference to achieve long-term wealth.
<br>Here is an essential long-term strategy to follow.<br>
<br>Balance your portfolio with different allocations of stocks and bonds. Sell some when they do well to buy other assets near the bottom of their cycle. Then, repeat the process. It does not get much simpler than that!&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>You know the old saying: Don't put all your eggs in one basket? Well, it’s true in the investing world.<br>
<br>Spreading your investments over many different market sectors gives you a higher probability of making gains over the long term and lowers the downside risk. Especially when you buy at meager prices and eventually sell when they are high.<br> <br>Some investors make gains of 150% to 300% profit!<br>If you want to see actual profits of portfolios as recent as 2017- 2021 and partake in<a href="investlongterm.html" class="text-primary"> <strong>global market investing ideas</strong></a>, look at his resource.<br></p>
