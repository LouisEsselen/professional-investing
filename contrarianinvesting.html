                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">While most investors focus on current market events, the latest trends, and stock picks, a different breed of investors is marching to a different beat. They have mastered the art of contrarian investing, stepping into the unknown, and going against all other investors' actions, thinking, and saying.<br>
<br>These investors are forward thinkers, and current financial news media does not sway their approach. They are tuned into ripe opportunities elsewhere in the markets nobody cares, sees, and knows about.<br>
<br>This path is unfamiliar to most investors, explaining why many never use this way of investing. However, it does offer a treasure trove of potentially lucrative long-term wealth not found in your day-to-day “recommended and popular stocks.”&nbsp;<br></p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Why some investors choose a contrarian investing approach</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">There are a few reasons why this breed of investor indulges in this way of investing.<br> 
<br><strong>1.	Buying low and sell for higher returns</strong>. The opportunity is ripe to buy stocks at rock-bottom prices and sell high later.
<br><strong>2.	Less downside risk exposure</strong>. These stocks often have lower risk exposure because they have experienced a significant price decline.
<br><strong>3.	Diversifying investments</strong>. Investing in many different sectors and themes lowers the overall risk exposure of your portfolio.
<br><strong>4.	More resilient portfolio</strong>. You can build a resilient portfolio by diversifying your investments. It safeguards against any unexpected volatility or loss in the markets.
<br><strong>5.	Long-term investment horizon</strong>. With a long-term investment horizon, short-term market volatility of the daily news cycles is not a threat to the investment.
<br><strong>6.	Out of favor, stocks are less competition</strong>. Investing in assets out of acceptance from the herd investors, you will likely face less competition, lower prices, and more significant upside potential than prevalent stocks.
<br>
<br>Applying a contrarian investment approach to out-of-favor assets is not for the faint-hearted. It carries significant risk, as most investments do.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Let’s examine famous contrarian investors and their unique investing approaches used to make fortunes. They’ve also written best-seller books.<br><br><strong>Warren Buffett</strong>&nbsp;needs no introduction, as he is often in the news. CEO and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffet, is well known for his deep value investing approach. His approach is finding undervalued companies with solid fundamentals and long-term potential. They say some companies he bought he never set foot in. He studied the company and management before deciding to buy in. This approach made him a billionaire many times over.<br><br><strong>George Soros</strong>: Another well-known hedge fund manager and philanthropist. He’s famous for a trade he did shorting the British pound in 1992.
<br>His approach – Soros identifies mispriced markets, taking positions against the trend. Here is a famous example.
<br>
<br>He was skeptical of the UK’s decision to join the European exchange rate mechanism, the ERM. It was established in 1979 to stabilize the exchange rates of European currencies in preparation for adopting the EURO currency.
<br>
<br>On “black” Wednesday, 16th September 1992, speculators forced the UK government to withdraw the pound from the ERM. This tipped the scale for the pound, and it started losing value. 
<br>
<br>He placed a $1.5 billion position to short the pound and later increased it to $10 billion. He walked away with more than $1 billion. 
<br>Five years later, in the Asian financial crisis, he placed a selling position on the Thai Baht, believing it was overvalued. It’s estimated he made about the same profit as he did with the pound.<br>Read more about his story here. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/george-soros-bank-of-england.asp" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/george-soros-bank-of-england.asp</a><br><br><strong>Sir John Templeton</strong> was a pioneer in the global investing arena.
<br>His approach: Founder of Templeton Growth Fund. He believed in finding distressed stocks in unpopular markets with growth potential and buying at a point of pessimism at its lowest.
<br>
<br><strong>Carl Icahn, the corporate raider</strong>: A fascinating and controversial Wall Street figure. He became known as a vulture capitalist. This came from taking considerable positions in public companies and then demanding extreme corporate structure leadership and management style changes. As a result, he often became the recipient of “greenmail” money. Quite a good way of getting paid!
<br>(<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenmail.asp " class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenmail.asp </a>) 
<br>
<br>His strategy mellowed from a vulture capitalist to a shareholder activist. He was lobbying for the rights of shareholders to bring positive change in a corporation.
<br>
<br><strong>Peter Lynch,</strong> a former fund manager of Fidelity's- Magellan Fund. He firmly believed in understanding what you own and adapting to the economic environment at the time. His fund reached an annualized return of 29.2 %, almost twice that of the S&amp;P500. Best-selling author of “One Up on Wall Street’ and “Beating the Street.”<br>
<br><strong>Bill Ackman</strong>, a hedge fund manager, Founder, and chief of Pershing Square Capital Management. The basics of his investing were like Carl Icahn. They were taking up prominent share positions in companies with the potential for significant improvement. Like Carl Icahn, Ackman became an activist investor.<br>
<br><strong>Jim Rogers</strong>&nbsp;is an American investor known as the co-founder of the Quantum Fund with George Soros and Soros Fund management. He also created the Rogers International Commodities Index.
<br>
<br>He achieved two extraordinary feats. 
<br>
<br>He traveled 100,000 miles around the world. He covered 16 continents on a motorcycle and later in a Mercedes with his wife, Paige Parker. Both journeys made the Guinness Book of World Records.
<br>These trips inspired him to write a book for each journey. (he’s written a few more books).
<br>
<br>In less than ten years, the fund he founded with Soros, the Quantum fund, returned an astonishing 4200%. He was decimating the mediocre 47% return of the S&amp;P500.<br>
<br>His primary focus is on commodities, hence the index he set up and invests in gold and silver. He also focuses on a specific country, entity, or theme he believes has the potential to profit. He was very bullish on commodities and emerging markets when they were widely unpopular with investors.
<br><br><strong>David Dreman:</strong> An investor and founder of an investment company, Dreman Value Management. Author of 4 books on contrarian strategies. He wrote one called “Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation.”
<br>
<br>His strategy is a refinement of strategies used by Sir John Templeton and Warren Buffett.
<br>
<br>Buying unpopular, undervalued stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios. Identifying companies out of favor with the public but have strong fundamentals.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">You may think some of these investors were lucky with their approach, but they are still in business today. They believed in their strategy and stuck to a plan each time.
<br>
<br>Templeton and Buffett found stocks in distress with deep value in unpopular markets.
<br>David Dreman echoed the strategies and sentiment of Templeton and Buffett.
<br>What’s interesting about Dreman is his thorough research into the company’s balance sheets—looking for the correct information to make informed investing decisions. 
<br>
<br>Do you do thorough research before you invest? Or do you follow what the news media says and go ahead and purchase?

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5"><strong>Contrarian investing strategy in action</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Let’s say you found deep value in 10 stocks in the Shipping Sector, a sector nobody is watching and certainly not going away.<br>Goods will always need to be shipped.<br><br>
Investing 10% of your investment portfolio in 10 different sector stocks at 1 to 2% each is the strategy here to diversify your portfolio.<br>
<br>In this example, you invest $1,000 in the shipping sector. 
<br>This would represent 10% of, say, an entire Portfolio of $10,000
<br>
<br>You invest $100 in 10 different stocks. 
<br>$100 x 10 = $1000
<br>
<br>Each stock represents 1% of your entire portfolio. This is important to lower risk exposure and allow probability to work for your whole portfolio. 
<br>
<br>After one year, 5 of the stocks went bankrupt. And each of the other 5 went up 180%.
<br>
<br>Now, your portfolio will look like this.
<br>
<br>Loss – 1% in each stock, so you lost 5% ($500) of the entire portfolio of $10,000.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>The other five stocks looked like this</strong>:
<br>
<br>Cost – 5 stocks x $100 = $500
<br>
<br>These five stocks went up by 180% each.<br>
<br>$100 + 180% = $280 each
<br>
<br>$280 x 5 = $1,400, giving you a 40% gain on your shipping portfolio.
<br>And a gain of 4% on your entire portfolio (10,000)<br><br>
Remember, this example is only in one market sector; if you repeat the same strategy in other sectors, you can build a portfolio with less chance of losing money, especially when you have explosive upside by leveraging probability. 
<br>
<br>The strategy works well if you buy stocks at rock-bottom prices. Sometimes, companies in this situation will enter a bull market, and you look at 20 times profits. There is also a high probability the stock will return to its previous high.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
